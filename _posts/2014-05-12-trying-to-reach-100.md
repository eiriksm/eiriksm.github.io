_100 days of github contrib that is_

[Different](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) [people](http://jaxbot.me/articles/100-days-of-github-contributions-5-5-2014) [have](http://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/) done this before, of course. But as I set out, it was mostly a challenge to myself, and just doing productive things in my spare time instead of wasting it away on something stupid.

Now, as I have realized a lot of times, last time this weekend, is that my own perception of doing something productive (writing code that probably does not have any practical effect, just for fun) might just as well be some other persons perception of wasting it aways on something stupid, but I'll live.

As of today, [I am at 93](https://github.com/eiriksm/) and ironically, publishing this post counts towards my stats (although I have commited something earler, so this is not my freebie:))

Lessons learned:

## It's fun to get counted. 
It feels like gameification. It's addicting. I just have to have my daily commit.

## Open source everything
As an effect of trying to commit every day, my commits needs to be public. So I solved that by always open-sourcing everything. That feels good too.

## Always contribute back
I immidiately try to fix/report issues I encounter with other projects, even if they are minor (instead of just being a little annoyed about it). Also, opening issues counts towards the streak!

## Always learn new things.
If I run out of issues or complete a project, I just dive into something new. Like a new language or a new framework. Got to have the daily commit!

## Conclusion
Although not concluded, I feel like the project has been very rewarding, and I hope it continues to be so for the next 100!
