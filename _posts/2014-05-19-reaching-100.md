## 100 days in a row with github commits.

So, [I reached 100 commits.](https://github.com/eiriksm/) today. It has been quite the experience. A couple of tricks I picked up to keep up the pace follows:

- If I am away (not near my computer) I can always open issues to make things count towards the total.
- If I have no internet, the commit will count for the day I actually commit it, not the day I push it.
- Having a ton of repos and starting new projects all the time, ensures that there is always something I should commit. Like upgrade a `package.json` file or restructure some code into some new best-practice I learned.
- If I am totally out of ideas or out of time, I can always write some documentation. There is always some docs that are incomplete or bad.

## What's next?

Well, I guess 100 more days?

In a more serious tone: I have a vacation coming up in a few weeks. I have a feeling I will commit most of the days on vacation too, but we'll see...
